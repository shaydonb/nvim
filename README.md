# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

## TODOs

- [ ] Create keyboard shortcuts for `quickfix` functionality in Rust.
- [ ] Transition away from LazyVim in order to retain better control and knowledge of all config options and plugins rather than leaning on Lazy defaults.
- [ ] Begin a recurring calendar item to stay with news and updates on NVIM, suggestion by Lilith: https://dotfyle.com/this-week-in-neovim
