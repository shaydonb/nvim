# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

My fork of the starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to start fresh.

## Quick Reference

- When completely unsure on how to do something, reference the help manual:
    - `:help`
- When having issues, checking the health of `nvim` is best:
    - `:checkhealth`

## TODOs

- [ ] Create keyboard shortcuts for `quickfix` functionality in Rust.
- [ ] Transition away from LazyVim in order to retain better control and knowledge of all config options and plugins rather than leaning on Lazy defaults.
- [ ] Begin a recurring calendar item to stay with news and updates on NVIM, suggestion by Lilith: https://dotfyle.com/this-week-in-neovim
